    <h1>About</h1>
    <!--<br></br>-->
    <p>Illinois Covid Modeling is a joint effort between Northwestern University and the University of Chicago, who have been modeling COVID-19 in Illinois since March 2020.
    In partnership with the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), we use simulation models to predict trends in hospital usage and deaths at the COVID-19 Region level.
    Both models are SEIR-based compartmental models that are calibrated to these data sources collected by IDPH:
    <ol>
    <li>daily census of non-ICU hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients</li>
    <li>daily census of ICU hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients</li>
    <li>COVID-like illness (CLI) hospital admissions</li>
    <li>COVID-attributed death data</li>
    </ol>
    Each team has created a suite of 11 models, one for each COVID-19 Region.
    We continuously perform other analyses of pandemic dynamics, some of which are featured on the Reports page.</p>
    <p>Code for Northwestern's simulation model is available <a href="https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago">here</a>. Northwestern is estimating \(R_t\) by
        applying the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/epyestim/">epyestim package</a> to the timeseries of daily new infections inferred from the simulation models.</p>
    <p>Code for University of Chicago's simulation model is available <a href="https://github.com/cobeylab/covid_IL">here</a>. The University of Chicago group is estimating \(R_t\) using methods in <a href="https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2">EpiNow2</a> to hospital admissions with COVID-like illness, which have tracked actual COVID-19 admissions very well. These estimates are checked against the \(R_t\) derived from the infection rates that are inferred from the dynamical model.</p>
    <p>Case and death data shown on the landing page are aggregated from <a href="https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/covid19-statistics"> county-level public data from IDPH </a>.</p>
    <h2>About the modeling teams</h2>
    <p>COVID-19 modeling at Northwestern is led by the <a href="https://www.numalariamodeling.org/">Malaria and COVID-19 Modeling Team</a>, an infectious disease modeling group with expertise in using models to inform policy. In addition to their COVID-19 work, they
    work with malaria-endemic countries to develop data-driven national strategic plans to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://cobeylab.uchicago.edu/">Cobey Lab</a> at the University of Chicago is an infectious disease modeling group with expertise in respiratory pathogens.
    In addition to their COVID-19 work, they study how the host adaptive immune response coevolves with pathogens, especially in ways relevant to epidemiological and evolutionary forecasting, vaccine design, and pathogen diversity.</p>
