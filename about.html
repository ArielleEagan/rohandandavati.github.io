    <!--<br></br>-->
    <p>Illinois Covid Modeling is a joint effort between Northwestern University and the University of Chicago, who have been modeling COVID-19 in Illinois since March 2020.
    In partnership with the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), we use simulation models to predict trends in hospital usage and deaths at the COVID-19 Region level.
    Both models are SEIR-based compartmental models that are calibrated to daily hospital census, ICU census, and death data collected by IDPH, and both teams have created a
        suite of 11 models, one for each COVID-19 Region.</p>
    <p>Code for University of Chicago's simulation model is available <a href="https://github.com/cobeylab/covid_IL">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Code for Northwestern's simulation model is available <a href="https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago">here</a>. Northwestern is estimating Rt by
        applying the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiEstim/index.html">EpiEstim package</a> to the timeseries of daily new infections inferred from the simulation models.</p>
    <p>Case and death data shown on the landing page are aggregated from <a href="https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/covid19-statistics"> county-level public data from IDPH </a>.</p>
